# We have moved
This was the old home of the Halcyon git repository. Since Microsoft announced to buy Github, we have moved to the open source code platform [NotABug](https://notabug.org). You can still find and download all Halcyon releases up to version 1.1.7 here. This repository is kept online to notify people who only know our old repository about our move. We will not upload any further changes to this repository and we won't react on any issues in this repository. Please use our new repository from now on: [notabug.org/halcyon-suite/halcyon](https://notabug.org/halcyon-suite/halcyon). If you don't want to sign up on another code hosting platform, you can alternatively write an post to our Mastodon account [@halcyon@social.csswg.org](https://social.csswg.org/@halcyon) or write us using our [contact form](http://www.nikisoft.one/contact.php). You can read more about our move in our blog post: [nikisoft.myblog.de/nikisoft/art/11626163/Our-move-from-Github-to-NotABug](https://nikisoft.myblog.de/nikisoft/art/11626163/Our-move-from-Github-to-NotABug)
